LogIsland is an event mining platform based on spark and Kafka to ingest a huge amount of log files.

Please follow the [getting started guide](/getting-started) if you want to start playing right now.




### First public release
This piece of software was born on mid 2013 as a log analysis tool that tried to detect malwares from Cisco firewall logs.
It has been in production since then, and has experienced several reworks to simplify the technological stack.
At first it was designed as a workflow of Flume agents, Pig ETL jobs and Mahout machine learning Map/reduce routines, but 
now it has evolved into a Spark/Kafka stack. 

This project is now released as an Open Source framework to help you scale and expand your traditionnal [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/downloads) or [FLume](https://flume.apache.org/)/[Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) stack.

### Additional advanced plugins
The original analytic part has been removed to an external plugin called Botsearch which is available on demand at [contact@hurence.com](mailto:contact@hurence.com)
but not as Open Source
