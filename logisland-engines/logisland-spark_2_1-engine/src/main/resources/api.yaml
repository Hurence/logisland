            should return every pipeline that should be running.
            On server side, logisland will do the delta and apply the following:

            - Add a new pipeline if any provided is not already running.

            - Reconfigure a pipeline if the same is already running and its configuration differs

            - Remove a pipeline if running but no more present in returned ones.
