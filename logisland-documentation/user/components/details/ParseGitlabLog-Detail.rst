The Gitlab logs processor is the Logisland entry point to get and process `Gitlab <https://www.gitlab.com>`_ logs. This allows for instance to monitor activities in your Gitlab server. The expected input of this processor are records from the production_json.log log file of Gitlab which contains JSON records. You can for instance use the `kafkacat <https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat>`_ command to inject those logs into kafka and thus Logisland.
