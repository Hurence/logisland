HBase_1_1_2_ClientService
-------------------------
Implementation of HBaseClientService for HBase 1.1.2. This service can be configured by providing a comma-separated list of configuration files, or by specifying values for the other properties. If configuration files are provided, they will be loaded first, and the values of the additional properties will override the values from the configuration files. In addition, any user defined properties on the processor will also be passed to the HBase configuration.

Note that although Elasticsearch 7.x still accepts type information, this implementation will ignore any type usage and will only work at the index level to be already compliant with the ElasticSearch 8.x version that will completely remove type usage.

.. _com.hurence.logisland.service.elasticsearch.Elasticsearch_7_x_ClientService: 

Elasticsearch_7_x_ClientService
-------------------------------
Implementation of ElasticsearchClientService for ElasticSearch 7.x. Note that although Elasticsearch 7.x still accepts type information, this implementation will ignore any type usage and will only work at the index level to be already compliant with the ElasticSearch 8.x version that will completely remove type usage.
